# Pre-workshop setup instructions

- Download and install the latest version of R: https://cran.r-project.org/
- Download and install the latest version of RStudio Desktop (Free License): https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/

Then, follow all the instructions in the "Installation" and "Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio" sections (Sections 1 and 2) at Happy Git with R by Jenny Bryan (http://happygitwithr.com). These sections cover git installation and connectiong RStudio with GitHub.

The workshop will go a lot smoother if you have completed the setup, so please attempt it beforehand. However if you have any difficulty with it, don't worry, we will have some time to work on the setup at the meetup as well.
